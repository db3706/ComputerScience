                        For example, if someone were to gather 50 gold coins, but they consistently harmed others during their stay in The Depths,
                        then I will deny access to the exit as they will cause harm to others outside of The Depths.
                        With that being said, I watched you treat others with respect and kindess, for the most part.
                        You helped that old man retrieve his cube and you kept your word by splitting the treasure with the explorer.
                        So, I permit you to leave this labyrinth and have a second chance at living your life out in the world.

                Some time before you arrived, there was a newcomer, and just like you, he wanted to escape by gathering enough coins to open the gate.
                    * ...
                        Unfortunately, before he managed to gather 50 gold coins, he discovered that he had an illness and only a few months left to live.
                            * ...
                                So, he spent his last remaining months creating a vault to protect his gold coin stash.
                                    * Why didn't he just share it?
                                        Buddy, we're sent down here for a reason... We're sent here due to low social credit, but social credit is mainly lowered due to severe crimes committed on the surface.
                                            * ... 
                                                With that being said, sharing it with random people in this place could potentially bring an irredeemable criminal one step closer to escaping, and I'm guessing that the man who stashed his gold didn't want this.
                                                    * I see...
                                                        But! I can tell that you aren't like those incorrigable criminals considering you haven't threatened me yet. So, I'd like to ask a favour of you. Of course there's a hefty reward.
                                                            * Sure, I'm listening...
                                                                Alright, so unbenkownst to everyone else, I actually found the location of the vault, but opening it is the tricky part.
                                                                    * Let me guess, there's a key... (mission_solved += 1)
                                                                        There's a ke-.. Yeah, there is... But, the creator of the vault actually made two keys and scattered them across the labyrinth. I haven't been able to find them, but you, being all adventurous and determined, could definitely find it.
                                                                        And also, if you're the lazy type, you can also buy dynamite as an alternative to opening that vault.
                                                                        So, the choice is yours. Do you want to find the two keys or buy dynamite for opening the vault?
                                                                            * I'll buy dynamite. (shopkeeper_open += 1)

                                                                                And also, I painted the vault door red so you can spot it easily
